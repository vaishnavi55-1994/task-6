3.Test each password on password strength checker.
 4.Note scores and feedback from the tool.

**5. Identify Best Practices for Strong Passwords**
Use long passwords (12+ characters)

Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols

Avoid dictionary words, names, or patterns (e.g., 1234, qwerty)

Do not reuse passwords across sites

Use a password manager to store complex ones

Add randomness (not just substitutions like "@" for "a")

**6. Tips Learned**
Password length is more important than complexity alone.

Avoid patterns and predictable substitutions.

Use passphrases (e.g., Blue!Table$Monkey88) for memorability and strength.

Change passwords if breached; use multi-factor authentication when possible.

Never write passwords in insecure places (sticky notes, unencrypted files).


**7. Research: Common Password Attacks**
**Attack Type**	                                   **Description**	                        ***Defense****
Brute Force	                                      Tries all combinations	            Long, complex passwords
Dictionary Attack                                  	Uses known word lists	          Avoid real words and common phrases

**8. Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security**
Short + simple = easily cracked in seconds or minutes.

Long + complex = takes billions of years to crack with current computing power.
